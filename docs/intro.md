# Welcome to your Tech Writing Task

In this task, you're going to use a simple page based on Docusaurus. You can run it locally


Let's discover **Docusaurus in less than 5 minutes**.


## First Things First: What You'll Need

If you'd like to [run this page locally](#start-your-site), you must install some packages:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.
- If you're using MacOS, you can also use [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)

## Start Your Site

After you've installed `Node.js`, you can easily run the development server, by running one of these commands in your code editor's terminal:

```bash
# Run this if you're using Node.js

npm run start

# Run this if you're using Yarn
yarn start
```


The `npm run start` or `yarn start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at `http://localhost:3000/`:

![Start your localhost](/img/starting-localhost.png)

Here's how your localhost should look like:

![Localhost](/img/localhost.png)

:::tip
When your localhost is active, whenever you make any changes in your markdown files and save them, the localhost will update automatically.

Try it!

## Get Yourself Comfortable

Now, you can click around the site, add new markdown files and see what's what. Check the [Create a Document](/tutorial-basics/create-document) tutorial to see how to easily add your markdown documents.

You can also check [Markdown features](/tutorial-basics/markdown-features) tutorial to see how to add nice formatting to your document.

And, whenever you're ready, check [Tech Writing Task](/Tech_Writing_Task/) - there are some things we'd like you to do :-).

Enjoy!
