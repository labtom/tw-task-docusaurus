# Markdown Features

Docusaurus supports **[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)** and a few **additional features**.

## Front Matter

Markdown documents have metadata at the top called [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/):

```text title="my-doc.md"
// highlight-start
---
id: my-doc-id
title: My document title
description: My document description
slug: /my-custom-url
---
// highlight-end

## Markdown heading

Markdown text with [links](./hello.md)
```

## Links

Regular Markdown links are supported, using url paths or relative file paths.

```md
Let's see how to complete my [Tech writing task](/tw-task).
```

```md
Let's see how to [Create a page](./Tech_Writing_task.mdx).
```

**Result:** Let's see how to complete my [Tech writing task](/tw-task).

## Images

Regular Markdown images are supported (put all your images in /static/img/ folder in this repository and use the `/img/{fileName}` path to render them in your [localhost]).

You can use absolute paths to reference images in the static directory (`static/img/docusaurus.png`):

```md
![Nobl9 logo](/img/logo_dark.svg)
```

![Nobl9 logo](/img/logo_dark.svg)

You can reference images relative to the current file as well. This is particularly useful to colocate images close to the Markdown files using them:

```md
![Docusaurus logo](./img/docusaurus.png)
```

## Code Blocks

Markdown code blocks are supported with Syntax highlighting.

:::

:::danger Take care

:::

:::caution Be cautious!

```

:::

:::caution Be cautious!

## MDX and React Components

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) can make your documentation more **interactive** and allows using any **React components inside Markdown**:

```jsx
export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (
  <span
    style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '20px',
      color: '#fff',
      padding: '10px',
      cursor: 'pointer',
    }}
    onClick={() => {
      alert(`You clicked the color ${color} with label ${children}`)
    }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);

This is <Highlight color="#25c2a0">Docusaurus green</Highlight> !

This is <Highlight color="#1877F2">Facebook blue</Highlight> !
```

export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (
  <span
    style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '20px',
      color: '#fff',
      padding: '10px',
      cursor: 'pointer',
    }}
    onClick={() => {
      alert(`You clicked the color ${color} with label ${children}`);
    }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);

This is <Highlight color="#25c2a0">Docusaurus green</Highlight> !

This is <Highlight color="#1877F2">Facebook blue</Highlight> !
